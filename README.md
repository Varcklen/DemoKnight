# DemoKnight

DemoKnight is one of the first Unity projects I created when I learned the editor.

<b>What is the game?</b><br>
You control a square man with a sword who can move around in a closed room and attack. Your goal is to defeat as many opponents as possible before dying. Opponents are diamond-shaped men, which may differ slightly in color and behavior (some run faster and attack, and some do more damage).

In the <b>Builds\Windows\Installer</b> Folder you can find the game installer if you want to check the game themself.
